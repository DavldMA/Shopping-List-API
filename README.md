# Shopping-List-API
This is a school project aimed at creating a robust API using Express.js and MongoDB for managing users and shopping lists. The API will serve as a backend for another project, providing endpoints to perform CRUD operations on users and their associated shopping lists. Additionally, the API supports generating shareable links for shopping lists.

## Features

- User Management: Create, read, update, and delete users.
- Shopping List Management: Create, read, update, and delete shopping lists for each user.
- Shareable Links: Generate unique URLs to share shopping lists with others.
- MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- Express.js Framework: Built on top of Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
